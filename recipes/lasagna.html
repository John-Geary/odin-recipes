    <h3>To assemble the lasagna</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1/2lb dry lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>15oz ricotta chese</li>
      <li>1 1/2lb mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
      <li>1/4lb freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="steps">
        Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch
        oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat is
        cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato
        sauce, crushed tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
        basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, salt, Italian seasoning,
        black pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into meat
        mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce for at
        least 1 hour (up to 6 for best flavor). Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li class="steps">
        Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very
        hot tap water; let soak for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="steps">
        Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2
        teaspoon salt, and nutmeg into egg until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li class="steps">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li class="steps">
        Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked
        lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of the shredded
        mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat
        layers twice more, ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover
        dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li class="steps">
        Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about
        45 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese topping is lightly
        browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
