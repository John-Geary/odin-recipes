  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This torched tiramisu is an easy-to-assemble tiramisu, topped with meringue, and toasted until golden with a
    kitchen torch. It's an impressive version of a fairly easy dessert.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp amaretto liquer</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup cold espresso</li>
    <li>24 ladyfingers</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
    <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cream of tartar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk mascarpone cheese, sugar, and amaretto liqueur in a bowl until smooth.</li>
    <li>Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: whipped cream
      should form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture. Pour espresso into a
      separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Dip 12 ladyfingers into espresso; arrange dipped ladyfingers in an 8-inch square baking pan. Spread 1/2
      mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers; using a mesh sieve, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder over the mascarpone
      layer. Dip remaining 12 ladyfingers into espresso; arrange dipped ladyfingers on top. Spread remaining 1/2
      mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers; sprinkle remaining cocoa powder over mascarpone layer. Refrigerate tiramisu
      until set, at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, prepare meringue. Beat egg whites, vanilla extract, and cream of tartar in a large bowl with an
      electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Keep refrigerated.</li>
    <li>Once tiramisu is completely chilled, pipe meringue on top of the tiramisu. Using a kitchen torch carefully toast
      the top until golden brown. Serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
